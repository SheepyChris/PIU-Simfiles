# PIU-Simfiles
Pump It Up simfiles from StepF2/P1 and The Resistance Simfiles updated to work better in StepMania/OutFox. The main goal of the repository is to organize, improve and update simfiles without going through the hoops of large update packs and confusing instructions. All files are updated to provide a proper `LASTSECONDHINT` value, Easy difficulties for demonstration mode, Medium/Hard difficulties for cabinet lights and other fixes/optimizations required outside of StepF2/P1.

## How to use
It is recommended to clone the repository through something such as GitHub Desktop in order to update your simfiles without requiring full redownloads in the future. The repository should be kept in a folder outside of your typical Songs game folder and then linked through `AdditionalSongFolders` in your `Preferences.ini` file.

This repository only contains the simfiles (.ssc) themselves, for all remaining media files you can download them through [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pO9rbaPUwTTDFuEo_4tX8S1BEwmfukeF?usp=sharing). To install the media files you simply need to merge both folders of each song group, all song folders should be populated with their media files without conflicts by doing so.

## Credits
All rights go to Andamiro and original authors of songs. These simfiles would also not be possible without the StepF2 and The Resistance Simfiles team, who have decrypted and recreated the content provided here. Shoutouts to kkclue for going through the trouble of updating and reorganizing all of the updates supplied by them.
